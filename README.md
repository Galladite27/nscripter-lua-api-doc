# *NScripter LUA API Documentation
This is a copy of the *NScripter LUA API documentation as found on [Senzogawa's site](http://senzogawa.s90.xrea.com/reference/NScrLuaAPI.html).
I want to eventually try and translate it (but if anyone speaks Japanese well and wants to contibute, please [contact me](https://galladite.net/about.html) as my Japanese is pretty awful) in order to eventually include it in the new [devkit](https://github.com/Galladite27/ONScripter-EN-devkit) I'm working on.

[Just leaving this link here for now](http://sorejyadamedarou.sakura.ne.jp/nscripter/nslua.htm)
